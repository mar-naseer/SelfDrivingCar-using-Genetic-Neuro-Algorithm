# SelfDrivingCar-using-Genetic-Neuro-Algorithm
I have created a Project that depicts how Artificial Neural Networks work, by comparing them with the real neural networks in our brain. I have worked with implementing a neural network and how to visualize it so we can see it in action. I have also worked and gained experience with concepts such as NeuralNetworks,Parrallelization,GeneticAlgorithm
